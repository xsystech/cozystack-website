## Introduction

A **tenant** in Cozystack is the primary unit of isolation and security, analogous to a Kubernetes namespace but with enhanced scope.
Each tenant represents an isolated environment with its own resources, networking, and RBAC (role-based access control).
Some cloud providers use the term "projects" for a similar entity.

Cozystack administrators and users create tenants using the [Tenant application]({{% ref "/docs/next/applications/tenant" %}})
from the application catalog.
Tenants can be created via the Cozystack dashboard (UI), `kubectl`, or directly via Cozystack API.


### Tenant Nesting

All user tenants belong to the base `root` tenant.
This `root` tenant is used only to deploy user tenants and system components.
All user-side applications are deployed in their respective tenants.

Tenants can be nested further: an administrator of a tenant can create sub-tenants as applications in the Cozystack catalog.
Parent tenants can share their resources with their children and oversee their applications.
In turn, children can use their parent's services.

### Sharing Cluster Services

Tenants may have [cluster services]({{% ref "/docs/next/operations/services" %}}) deployed in them.
Cluster services are middleware services providing core functionality to the tenants and user-facing applications.

The `root` tenant has a set of services like `etcd`, `ingress`, and `monitoring` by default.
Lower-level tenants can run their own cluster services or access ones of their parent.

For example, a Cozystack user creates the following tenants and services:

- Tenant `foo` inside of tenant `root`, having its own instances of `etcd` and `monitoring` running.
- Tenant `bar` inside of tenant `foo`, having its own instance of `etcd`.
- [Tenant Kubernetes cluster]({{% ref "/docs/next/kubernetes" %}}) and a
  [Postgres database]({{% ref "/docs/next/applications/postgres" %}}) in the tenant `bar`.

All applications need services like `ingress` and `monitoring`. 
Since tenant `bar` does not have these services, the applications will use the parent tenant's services.

Here's how this configuration will be resolved:

-   The tenant Kubernetes cluster will store its data in the `bar` tenant's own `etcd` service.
-   All metrics will be collected in the monitoring stack of the parent tenant `foo`.
-   Access to the applications will be through the common `ingress` deployed in the tenant `root`.

### Network Isolation Between Tenants

Every tenant namespace is isolated from its siblings by Cilium network
policies installed automatically by the `tenant` chart. There is no
per-tenant opt-out: the previous `isolated` field was removed in
Cozystack v1.0. Pods inside a tenant namespace also cannot reach
`kube-apiserver` by default, or the tenant's own `etcd` when the tenant
was created with `etcd: true` — they need to opt in with one of two pod
labels:

-   `policy.cozystack.io/allow-to-apiserver: "true"` — reach the
    in-cluster Kubernetes API (for operators, dashboards, etc.).
-   `policy.cozystack.io/allow-to-etcd: "true"` — reach the tenant's
    own etcd (only applicable when the tenant was created with
    `etcd: true`).

See [Tenant `isolated` flag removed]({{% ref "/docs/next/operations/upgrades#tenant-isolated-flag-removed" %}})
in the upgrade notes for a full worked example.


### Customizing Tenant Services

The tenant flags `etcd`, `monitoring`, `ingress`, and `seaweedfs` install a
*default* configuration of each service. After the service is running, you
can change its spec — add storage pools, tune resource quotas, switch a
SeaweedFS topology to `MultiZone`, etc. — by editing the underlying
application CR. Those manual edits are **not** overwritten when the parent
`Tenant` reconciles.

The workflow has two steps:

1. Turn on the flag on the tenant (checkbox in the Dashboard, or `etcd: true` /
   `seaweedfs: true` / ... under `spec.values` in the Tenant `HelmRelease`
   manifest you apply with `kubectl`). Cozystack creates the matching
   application CR with defaults.
2. Edit the application CR in place. For example, to add a pool to the
   tenant-root SeaweedFS instance:

   ```bash
   kubectl edit -n tenant-root seaweedfses.apps.cozystack.io seaweedfs
   ```

   Or patch it non-interactively:

   ```bash
   kubectl patch -n tenant-root seaweedfses.apps.cozystack.io seaweedfs \
     --type=merge -p '{"spec":{"volume":{"pools":{"ssd":{"diskType":"ssd","size":"50Gi"}}}}}'
   ```

The same pattern applies to every tenant-level application CR: `etcd`,
`monitoring`, `ingress`, `seaweedfs`. See
[SeaweedFS storage pools]({{% ref "/docs/next/operations/services/object-storage/storage-pools" %}})
for a worked example that walks the full flow — enabling SeaweedFS on the
tenant and then customizing the resulting CR.

{{% alert color="warning" %}}
Do not try to preconfigure a tenant-level service by applying its CR manifest
*before* the tenant is created — you will hit "namespace not found". And
editing the `Tenant` resource itself to nest service-specific fields (like
SeaweedFS `pools`) under the `Tenant` spec does not work either: tenant-level
flags are booleans, the per-service spec is a separate resource. Enable the
flag first, edit the downstream CR second.

### Unique Domain Names

Each tenant has its own domain.
By default, (unless otherwise specified), it inherits the domain of its parent with a prefix of its name.
For example, if the `root` tenant has domain `example.org`, then tenant `foo` gets the domain `foo.example.org` by default.
However, it can be redefined to have another domain, such as `example.com`.

Kubernetes clusters created in this tenant namespace would get domains like: `kubernetes-cluster.foo.example.org`


### Tenant Naming Limitations

Tenant names must be alphanumeric.
Using dashes (`-`) in tenant names is not allowed, unlike with other services.
This limitation exists to keep consistent naming in tenants, nested tenants, and services deployed in them.

For example:

-   The root tenant is named `root`, but internally it's referenced as `tenant-root`.
-   A user tenant is named `foo`, which results in `tenant-foo`.
-   However, a tenant cannot be named `foo-bar`, because parsing names like `tenant-foo-bar` can be ambiguous.

### Tenant Namespace Layout

Each tenant corresponds to a Kubernetes workload namespace. The `root`
tenant is a special case: its namespace is hardcoded to `tenant-root`.
For every nested tenant, the namespace is derived from its parent's
workload namespace and its own name using two rules:

- A tenant created directly inside `tenant-root` gets the namespace
  `tenant-<name>`. The parent's `tenant-root-` prefix is **not** included.
- A tenant created at any deeper level gets the namespace
  `<parent-workload-namespace>-<name>`, appending the child's name to the
  parent's full namespace.

For example, starting from `tenant-root`:

| Tenant path             | Workload namespace         |
| ---                     | ---                        |
| `root`                  | `tenant-root`              |
| `root/alpha`            | `tenant-alpha`             |
| `root/alpha/beta`       | `tenant-alpha-beta`        |
| `root/alpha/beta/gamma` | `tenant-alpha-beta-gamma`  |

Both the `tenant` Helm chart and the aggregated API implement these rules
when a new tenant is created:

- the Helm chart helper in
  [`packages/apps/tenant/templates/_helpers.tpl`](https://github.com/cozystack/cozystack/blob/main/packages/apps/tenant/templates/_helpers.tpl)
  computes the namespace for the child release being installed,
- the `computeTenantNamespace` function in
  [`pkg/registry/apps/application/rest.go`](https://github.com/cozystack/cozystack/blob/main/pkg/registry/apps/application/rest.go)
  publishes the same value as `status.namespace` on the `Tenant` CR.

Because tenant names themselves are constrained to be alphanumeric (see
*Tenant Naming Limitations* above), namespace fragments never contain
tenant-internal dashes.

{{% alert color="warning" %}}
Kubernetes namespace names are RFC 1123 labels and cannot exceed **63
characters**. Because deeper tenants accumulate the full ancestor chain
into their workload namespace name (`tenant-alpha-beta-gamma`), long tenant
names combined with deep nesting can bump into this limit. Plan the
hierarchy accordingly: short tenant names at deeper levels, or shallower
trees when long names are unavoidable. Kubernetes will reject the namespace
creation if the computed name exceeds 63 characters, and the containing
`tenant` Helm release will surface that rejection as a reconcile failure.

### Deriving Parent and Child Relationships

Downstream integrations — custom dashboards, audit tooling, cost-allocation
jobs, policy engines — sometimes need to walk the tenant tree to render
breadcrumbs, compute inherited settings, or scope queries. A tempting
shortcut is to derive the parent namespace by splitting the workload
namespace on `-` and rebuilding it minus the last segment. That works
today only because tenant names are constrained to be alphanumeric, so
the `-` character unambiguously separates ancestor segments; it also
assumes the current namespace-generation rules never change. Both
assumptions are implementation details, not a stable contract.

The stable contract is the `Tenant` custom resource itself. Cozystack
stores every `Tenant` CR in its parent's workload namespace, so:

- **`metadata.namespace`** of a `Tenant` CR equals the **parent's** workload
  namespace. This is the reliable pointer to the parent — no string parsing
  required.
- **`status.namespace`** of a `Tenant` CR equals the tenant's **own** workload
  namespace (the one where the tenant's applications, nested tenants, and
  `HelmRelease`s live).
- To list the direct children of a tenant with workload namespace `N`, list
  `Tenant` CRs whose `metadata.namespace == N`. With `kubectl`, this is a
  single command against the parent's workload namespace:

  ```bash
  kubectl get tenants --namespace <parent-workload-namespace>
  ```

  The `tenants` resource is served by the Cozystack aggregated API
  (`apps.cozystack.io/v1alpha1`), so `cozystack-api` must be running and
  reachable from the client. Run `kubectl api-resources --api-group apps.cozystack.io`
  to confirm the resource is visible from your kubeconfig context.

This approach is stable regardless of whether the tenant is a direct child of
`tenant-root` or a deeper descendant, and it survives any future adjustments
to the namespace layout because it does not depend on the layout at all.
