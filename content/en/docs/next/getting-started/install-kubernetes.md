## Objectives

We start this step of the tutorial, having [three nodes with Talos Linux installed on them]({{% ref "/docs/next/getting-started/install-talos" %}}).

As a result of this step, we will have a Kubernetes cluster installed, configured, and ready to install Cozystack.
We will also have a `kubeconfig` for this cluster, and will have performed basic checks on the cluster.

## Installing Kubernetes

Install and bootstrap a Kubernetes cluster using [Talm]({{% ref "/docs/next/install/kubernetes/talm" %}}), a declarative CLI configuration tool with ready configuration presets for Cozystack.

This part of the tutorial is being reworked.
It will include simplified instructions for Talm installation, without all the extra options and corner cases, included in the main Talm guide.

## Next Step

Continue the Cozystack tutorial by [installing and configuring Cozystack]({{% ref "/docs/next/getting-started/install-cozystack" %}}).
