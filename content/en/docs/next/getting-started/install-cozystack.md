## Objectives

{{% alert color="info" %}}
This tutorial covers installing Cozystack as a **ready-to-use platform**.
If you want to build your own platform by installing only specific components,
see the [BYOP (Build Your Own Platform) guide]({{% ref "/docs/next/install/cozystack/kubernetes-distribution" %}}).
{{% /alert %}}

In this step of the tutorial, we'll install Cozystack on top of a [Kubernetes cluster, prepared in the previous step]({{% ref "./install-kubernetes" %}}).

The tutorial will guide you through the following stages:

1.  Install the Cozystack operator
1.  Prepare a Cozystack configuration file and apply it
1.  Configure storage
1.  Configure networking
1.  Deploy etcd, ingress and monitoring stack in the root tenant
1.  Finalize deployment and access Cozystack dashboard

## 1. Install the Cozystack Operator

Install the Cozystack operator using the Helm chart from the OCI registry.
The operator manages all Cozystack components and handles the Platform Package lifecycle.

```bash
helm upgrade --install cozystack oci://ghcr.io/cozystack/cozystack/cozy-installer \
  --version X.Y.Z \
  --namespace cozy-system \
  --create-namespace
```

Replace `X.Y.Z` with the desired Cozystack version.
You can find available versions on the [Cozystack releases page](https://github.com/cozystack/cozystack/releases).

{{% alert color="info" %}}
**If the install aborts because `cozy-system` already exists.** Helm refuses
to take over a namespace it did not create and prints an `invalid ownership
metadata` error (or `namespaces "cozy-system" already exists`, depending on
the Helm version) when `cozy-system` was left over from an earlier aborted
install or was created manually for this purpose.

If the namespace is **not** managed by another tool (Terraform, Argo CD, a
different Helm release, etc.), rerun the command with `--take-ownership`
(requires Helm 3.17+) to let Helm adopt it:

```bash
helm upgrade --install cozystack oci://ghcr.io/cozystack/cozystack/cozy-installer \
  --version X.Y.Z \
  --namespace cozy-system \
  --create-namespace \
  --take-ownership
```

Do not use `--take-ownership` if `cozy-system` is owned by another system —
Helm will silently become the new owner and subsequent upgrades or an
uninstall of the Cozystack release may mutate or delete the namespace (and
anything else the flag adopted) against the wishes of that other system.

## 2. Prepare and Apply the Platform Package

### 2.1. Prepare a Configuration File

Now that the operator is running, we will prepare a configuration file for it.
Take the example below and write it in a file **cozystack-platform.yaml**:

```yaml
apiVersion: cozystack.io/v1alpha1
kind: Package
metadata:
  name: cozystack.cozystack-platform
spec:
  variant: isp-full
  components:
    platform:
      values:
        publishing:
          host: "example.org"
          apiServerEndpoint: "https://api.example.org:443"
          exposedServices:
            - dashboard
            - api
        networking:
          podCIDR: "10.244.0.0/16"
          podGateway: "10.244.0.1"
          serviceCIDR: "10.96.0.0/16"
          joinCIDR: "100.64.0.0/16"
```

Action points:

1.  Replace `example.org` in `publishing.host` and `publishing.apiServerEndpoint` with a routable fully-qualified domain name (FQDN) that you control.
    If you only have a public IP, but no FQDN, use [nip.io](https://nip.io/) with dash notation.
2.  Use the same values for `networking.*` as on the previous step, where you bootstrapped a Kubernetes cluster with Talm or `talosctl`.
    Settings provided in the example are sane defaults that can be used in most cases.

There are other values in this config that you don't need to change in the course of the tutorial.
However, let's overview and explain each value:

-   `metadata.name` must be `cozystack.cozystack-platform` to match the PackageSource created by the installer.
-   `publishing.host` is used as the main domain for all services created under Cozystack, such as the dashboard, Grafana, Keycloak, etc.
-   `publishing.apiServerEndpoint` is the Cluster API endpoint. It's used for generating kubeconfig files for your users. It is recommended to use routable IP addresses instead of local ones.
-   `spec.variant: "isp-full"` means that we're using the most complete set of Cozystack components.
    Learn more about variants in the [Cozystack Variants reference]({{% ref "/docs/next/operations/configuration/variants" %}}).
-   `publishing.exposedServices` lists services to make accessible by users — here the dashboard (UI) and API.
-   `networking.*` are internal networking configurations for the underlying Kubernetes cluster:
    -   `networking.podCIDR` — CIDR range from which Kube-OVN allocates pod IPs. Must not overlap with
        any network your nodes already route.
    -   `networking.podGateway` — gateway address Kube-OVN assigns to the default pod subnet. Use the
        `.1` address of the `podCIDR` network (for example, `10.244.0.1` for `10.244.0.0/16`).
    -   `networking.serviceCIDR` — CIDR range for `ClusterIP` Services. This **must** match the
        `cluster.network.serviceSubnets` value you used when bootstrapping the Kubernetes cluster:
        the value is baked into the kube-apiserver at bootstrap time and cannot be changed without
        rebuilding the cluster, so a mismatch here silently breaks DNS and service routing.
    -   `networking.joinCIDR` — CIDR range for the Kube-OVN *join* subnet, the internal network that carries
        traffic between cluster nodes and pods. The default `100.64.0.0/16` is part of the
        [RFC 6598](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc6598) shared address space (`100.64.0.0/10`)
        that is reserved for this kind of internal-only use. Change it only if it overlaps with a network
        your nodes already route; see the
        [Kube-OVN join subnet reference](https://kubeovn.github.io/docs/stable/en/guide/subnet/#join-subnet)
        for background on what this subnet does.

You can learn more about this configuration file in the [Platform Package reference]({{% ref "/docs/next/operations/configuration/platform-package" %}}).

Cozystack gathers anonymous usage statistics by default. Learn more about what data is collected and how to opt out in the [Telemetry Documentation]({{% ref "/docs/next/operations/configuration/telemetry" %}}).

### 2.2. Apply the Platform Package

Apply the configuration file:

```bash
kubectl apply -f cozystack-platform.yaml
```

As the installation goes on, you can track the logs of the operator:

```bash
kubectl logs -n cozy-system deploy/cozystack-operator -f
```


### 2.3. Check Installation Status

Wait for a while, then check the status of installation:

```bash
kubectl get hr -A
```

Wait and check again until you see `True` on each line, as in this example:

```console
NAMESPACE                        NAME                        AGE    READY   STATUS

tenant-root                      tenant-root                 4m1s   True    Release reconciliation succeeded
```

The list of components in your installation may be different from the example above,
as it depends on your configuration and Cozystack version.

Once every component shows `READY: True`, we're ready to proceed by configuring subsystems.


## 3. Configure Storage

Kubernetes needs a storage subsystem to provide persistent volumes to applications, but it doesn't include one of its own.
Cozystack provides [LINSTOR](https://github.com/LINBIT/linstor-server) as a storage subsystem.

In the following steps, we'll access LINSTOR interface, create storage pools, and define storage classes.


### 3.1. Check Storage Devices

1.  Set up an alias to access LINSTOR:

    ```bash
    alias linstor='kubectl exec -n cozy-linstor deploy/linstor-controller -- linstor'
    ```

1.  List your nodes and check their readiness:

    ```bash
    linstor node list
    ```

    Example output shows node names and state:

    ```console
    +-------------------------------------------------------+
    | Node | NodeType  | Addresses                 | State  |
    |=======================================================|
    | srv1 | SATELLITE | 192.168.100.11:3367 (SSL) | Online |
    | srv2 | SATELLITE | 192.168.100.12:3367 (SSL) | Online |
    | srv3 | SATELLITE | 192.168.100.13:3367 (SSL) | Online |
    +-------------------------------------------------------+
    ```

1.  List available empty devices:

    ```bash
    linstor physical-storage list
    ```

    Example output shows the same node names:

    ```console
    +--------------------------------------------+
    | Size         | Rotational | Nodes          |
    |============================================|
    | 107374182400 | True       | srv3[/dev/sdb] |
    |              |            | srv1[/dev/sdb] |
    |              |            | srv2[/dev/sdb] |
    +--------------------------------------------+
    ```

### 3.2. Create Storage Pools

1.  Create storage pools using ZFS:

    ```bash
    linstor ps cdp zfs srv1 /dev/sdb --pool-name data --storage-pool data
    linstor ps cdp zfs srv2 /dev/sdb --pool-name data --storage-pool data
    linstor ps cdp zfs srv3 /dev/sdb --pool-name data --storage-pool data
    ```

    It is [recommended](https://github.com/LINBIT/linstor-server/issues/463#issuecomment-3401472020)
    to set `failmode=continue` on ZFS storage pools to allow DRBD to handle disk failures instead of ZFS.

    ```bash
    kubectl exec -ti -n cozy-linstor pod/linstor-satellite.srv1 -- zpool set failmode=continue data
    kubectl exec -ti -n cozy-linstor pod/linstor-satellite.srv2 -- zpool set failmode=continue data
    kubectl exec -ti -n cozy-linstor pod/linstor-satellite.srv3 -- zpool set failmode=continue data
    ```

1.  Check the results by listing the storage pools:

    ```bash
    linstor sp l
    ```

    Example output:

    ```console
    +-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+
    | StoragePool          | Node | Driver   | PoolName | FreeCapacity | TotalCapacity | CanSnapshots | State | SharedName                |
    |=====================================================================================================================================|
    | DfltDisklessStorPool | srv1 | DISKLESS |          |              |               | False        | Ok    | srv1;DfltDisklessStorPool |
    | DfltDisklessStorPool | srv2 | DISKLESS |          |              |               | False        | Ok    | srv2;DfltDisklessStorPool |
    | DfltDisklessStorPool | srv3 | DISKLESS |          |              |               | False        | Ok    | srv3;DfltDisklessStorPool |
    | data                 | srv1 | ZFS      | data     |    96.41 GiB |     99.50 GiB | True         | Ok    | srv1;data                 |
    | data                 | srv2 | ZFS      | data     |    96.41 GiB |     99.50 GiB | True         | Ok    | srv2;data                 |
    | data                 | srv3 | ZFS      | data     |    96.41 GiB |     99.50 GiB | True         | Ok    | srv3;data                 |
    +-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+
    ```

### 3.3. Create Storage Classes

Finally, we can create a couple of storage classes, one of which will be the default class.


1.  Create a file with storage class definitions.
    Below is a sane default example providing two classes: `local` (default) and `replicated`.

    **storageclasses.yaml:**

    ```yaml
    ---
    apiVersion: storage.k8s.io/v1
    kind: StorageClass
    metadata:
      name: local
      annotations:
        storageclass.kubernetes.io/is-default-class: "true"
    provisioner: linstor.csi.linbit.com
    parameters:
      linstor.csi.linbit.com/storagePool: "data"
      linstor.csi.linbit.com/layerList: "storage"
      linstor.csi.linbit.com/allowRemoteVolumeAccess: "false"
    volumeBindingMode: WaitForFirstConsumer
    allowVolumeExpansion: true
    ---
    apiVersion: storage.k8s.io/v1
    kind: StorageClass
    metadata:
      name: replicated
    provisioner: linstor.csi.linbit.com
    parameters:
      linstor.csi.linbit.com/storagePool: "data"
      linstor.csi.linbit.com/autoPlace: "3"
      linstor.csi.linbit.com/layerList: "drbd storage"
      linstor.csi.linbit.com/allowRemoteVolumeAccess: "true"
      property.linstor.csi.linbit.com/DrbdOptions/auto-quorum: suspend-io
      property.linstor.csi.linbit.com/DrbdOptions/Resource/on-no-data-accessible: suspend-io
      property.linstor.csi.linbit.com/DrbdOptions/Resource/on-suspended-primary-outdated: force-secondary
      property.linstor.csi.linbit.com/DrbdOptions/Net/rr-conflict: retry-connect
    volumeBindingMode: Immediate
    allowVolumeExpansion: true
    ```

1.  Apply the storage class configuration

    ```bash
    kubectl apply -f storageclasses.yaml
    ```

1.  Check that the storage classes were successfully created:

    ```bash
    kubectl get storageclasses
    ```

    Example output:

    ```console
    NAME              PROVISIONER              RECLAIMPOLICY   VOLUMEBINDINGMODE      ALLOWVOLUMEEXPANSION   AGE
    local (default)   linstor.csi.linbit.com   Delete          WaitForFirstConsumer   true                   11m
    replicated        linstor.csi.linbit.com   Delete          Immediate              true                   11m
    ```


## 4. Configure Networking

Next, we will configure how the Cozystack cluster can be accessed.
This step has two options depending on your available infrastructure:

-   For your own bare metal or self-hosted VMs, choose the MetalLB option.
    MetalLB is Cozystack's default load balancer.
-   For VMs and dedicated servers from cloud providers, choose the public IP setup.
    [Most cloud providers don't support MetalLB](https://metallb.universe.tf/installation/clouds/).

    Check out the [provider-specific installation]({{% ref "/docs/next/install/providers" %}}) section.
    It may have instructions for your provider, which you can use to deploy a production-ready cluster.

### 4.a MetalLB Setup

Cozystack has three types of IP addresses used:

-   Node IPs: persistent and valid only within the cluster.
-   Virtual floating IP: used to access one of the nodes in the cluster and valid only within the cluster.
-   External access IPs: used by LoadBalancers to expose services outside the cluster.

Services with external IPs may be exposed in two modes: L2 and BGP.
L2 mode is a simple one, but requires that nodes belong to a single L2 domain, and does not load-balance well.
BGP has more complicated setup -- you need BGP peers ready to accept announces, but gives the ability to make proper load-balancing, and provides more options for choosing IP address ranges.

Select a range of unused IPs for the services, here will use the `192.168.100.200-192.168.100.250` range.
If you use L2 mode, these IPs should either be from the same network as the nodes, or have all necessary routes to them.

For BGP mode, you will also need BGP peer IP addresses and local and remote AS numbers. Here we will use `192.168.20.254` as peer IP, and AS numbers 65000 and 65001 as local and remote.

Create and apply a file describing an address pool.

**metallb-ip-address-pool.yml**
```yaml
apiVersion: metallb.io/v1beta1
kind: IPAddressPool
metadata:
  name: cozystack
  namespace: cozy-metallb
spec:
  addresses:
    # used to expose services outside the cluster
    - 192.168.100.200-192.168.100.250
  autoAssign: true
  avoidBuggyIPs: false
```

```bash
kubectl apply -f metallb-ip-address-pool.yml
```

Create and apply resources needed for an L2 or a BGP advertisement.

{{< tabs name="metallb_announce" >}}
{{% tab name="L2 mode" %}}
L2Advertisement uses the name of the IPAddressPool resource we created previously.

**metallb-l2-advertisement.yml**
```yaml
apiVersion: metallb.io/v1beta1
kind: L2Advertisement
metadata:
  name: cozystack
  namespace: cozy-metallb
spec:
  ipAddressPools:
    - cozystack
```
<br/>

Apply changes.

```bash
kubectl apply -f metallb-l2-advertisement.yml
```
{{% /tab %}}
{{% tab name="BGP mode" %}}
First, create a separate BGPPeer resource for **each** peer.

**metallb-bgp-peer.yml**
```yaml
apiVersion: metallb.io/v1beta2
kind: BGPPeer
metadata:
  name: peer1
  namespace: cozy-metallb
spec:
  myASN: 65000
  peerASN: 65001
  peerAddress: 192.168.20.254
```
<br/>

Next, create a single BGPAdvertisement resource.

**metallb-bgp-advertisement.yml**
```yaml
apiVersion: metallb.io/v1beta1
kind: BGPAdvertisement
metadata:
  name: cozystack
  namespace: cozy-metallb
spec:
  ipAddressPools:
  - cozystack
```
<br/>
Apply changes.

```bash
kubectl apply -f metallb-bgp-peer.yml
kubectl apply -f metallb-bgp-advertisement.yml
```
{{% /tab %}}
{{< /tabs >}}
<br/>

Now that MetalLB is configured, enable `ingress` in the `tenant-root`:

```bash
kubectl patch -n tenant-root tenants.apps.cozystack.io root --type=merge -p '
{"spec":{
  "ingress": true
}}'
```

To confirm successful configuration, check the HelmReleases `ingress` and `ingress-nginx-system`:

```bash
kubectl -n tenant-root get hr ingress ingress-nginx-system
```

Example of correct output:
```console
NAME                   AGE   READY   STATUS
ingress                47m   True    Helm upgrade succeeded for release tenant-root/ingress.v3 with chart ingress@1.8.0
ingress-nginx-system   47m   True    Helm upgrade succeeded for release tenant-root/ingress-nginx-system.v2 with chart cozy-ingress-nginx@0.35.1
```

Next, check the state of service `root-ingress-controller`:

```bash
kubectl -n tenant-root get svc root-ingress-controller
```

The service should be deployed as `TYPE: LoadBalancer` and have correct external IP:

```console
NAME                      TYPE           CLUSTER-IP      EXTERNAL-IP       PORT(S)          AGE
root-ingress-controller   LoadBalancer   10.96.91.83     192.168.100.200   80/TCP,443/TCP   48m
```

### 4.b. Node Public IP Setup

If your cloud provider does not support MetalLB, you can expose ingress controller using external IPs on your nodes.

If public IPs are attached directly to nodes, specify them.
If public IPs are provided with a 1:1 NAT, as some clouds do, use IP addresses of **external** network interfaces.

Here we will use `192.168.100.11`, `192.168.100.12`, and `192.168.100.13`.

First, patch the Platform Package with the external IPs:

```bash
kubectl patch packages.cozystack.io cozystack.cozystack-platform --type=merge -p '{
  "spec": {
    "components": {
      "platform": {
        "values": {
          "publishing": {
            "externalIPs": [
              "192.168.100.11",
              "192.168.100.12",
              "192.168.100.13"
            ]
          }
        }
      }
    }
  }
}'
```

Next, enable `ingress` for the root tenant:

```bash
kubectl patch -n tenant-root tenants.apps.cozystack.io root --type=merge -p '{
  "spec":{
    "ingress": true
  }
}'
```

Finally, add external IPs to the `externalIPs` list in the Ingress configuration:

```bash
kubectl patch -n tenant-root ingresses.apps.cozystack.io ingress --type=merge -p '{
  "spec":{
    "externalIPs": [
      "192.168.100.11",
      "192.168.100.12",
      "192.168.100.13"
    ]
  }
}'
```

After that, your Ingress will be available on the specified IPs.
Check it in the following way:

```bash
kubectl get svc -n tenant-root root-ingress-controller
```

The service should be deployed as `TYPE: ClusterIP` and have the full range of external IPs:

```console
NAME                     TYPE       CLUSTER-IP   EXTERNAL-IP                                   PORT(S)         AGE
root-ingress-controller  ClusterIP  10.96.91.83  192.168.100.11,192.168.100.12,192.168.100.13  80/TCP,443/TCP  48m
```

## 5. Finalize Installation

### 5.1. Setup Root Tenant Services

Enable `etcd` and `monitoring` for the root tenant:

```bash
kubectl patch -n tenant-root tenants.apps.cozystack.io root --type=merge -p '
{"spec":{
  "monitoring": true,
  "etcd": true
}}'
```

### 5.2. Check the cluster state and composition

Check the provisioned persistent volumes:

```bash
kubectl get pvc -n tenant-root
```

Example output:

```console

Check that all pods are running:

```bash
kubectl get pod -n tenant-root
```

Get the public IP of ingress controller:

```bash
kubectl get svc -n tenant-root root-ingress-controller
```

Example output:

```console
NAME                      TYPE           CLUSTER-IP     EXTERNAL-IP       PORT(S)                      AGE
root-ingress-controller   LoadBalancer   10.96.16.141   192.168.100.200   80:31632/TCP,443:30113/TCP   3m33s
```

### 5.3 Access the Cozystack Dashboard

If you included `dashboard` in the `publishing.exposedServices` list of your Platform Package (as shown in step 2), the Cozystack Dashboard is already available.

If the initial configuration did not include it, patch the Platform Package:

```bash
kubectl patch packages.cozystack.io cozystack.cozystack-platform --type=json \
  -p '[{"op": "add", "path": "/spec/components/platform/values/publishing/exposedServices/-", "value": "dashboard"}]'
```

Open `dashboard.example.org` to access the system dashboard, where `example.org` is your domain specified for `tenant-root`.
There you will see a login window which expects an authentication token.

Get the authentication token for `tenant-root`:

```bash
kubectl get secret -n tenant-root tenant-root -o go-template='{{ printf "%s\n" (index .data "token" | base64decode) }}'
```

Log in using the token.
Now you can use the dashboard as an administrator.

Further on, you will be able to:

-   Set up OIDC to authenticate with it instead of tokens.
-   Create user tenants and grant users access to them via tokens or OIDC.

### 5.4 Access metrics in Grafana

Use `grafana.example.org` to access the system monitoring, where `example.org` is your domain specified for `tenant-root`.
In this example, `grafana.example.org` is located at 192.168.100.200.

-   login: `admin`
-   request a password:

    ```bash
    kubectl get secret -n tenant-root grafana-admin-password -o go-template='{{ printf "%s\n" (index .data "password" | base64decode) }}'
    ```
