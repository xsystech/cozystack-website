## Toolchain

You will need the following tools installed on your workstation:

-   [talosctl](https://www.talos.dev/{{< version-pin "talos_minor" >}}/talos-guides/install/talosctl/), the command line client for Talos Linux (use the {{< version-pin "talos_minor" >}}.x series that matches Cozystack {{< version-pin "cozystack_version" >}}).
-   [kubectl](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/tools/#kubectl), the command line client for Kubernetes.
-   [Talm](https://github.com/cozystack/talm?tab=readme-ov-file#installation), Cozystack's own configuration manager for Talos Linux:<br>
    
    ```bash
    curl -sSL https://github.com/cozystack/talm/raw/refs/heads/main/hack/install.sh | sh -s
    ```

## Hardware Requirements

To run this tutorial, you will need the following setup:

**Cluster nodes:** three bare-metal servers or virtual machines. Hardware requirements depend on your usage scenario:

{{< include "docs/next/install/_include/hardware-config-tabs.md" >}}

**Storage:**
-   **Primary Disk**: Used for Talos Linux, etcd storage, and downloaded images. Low latency is required.
-   **Secondary Disk**: Used for user application data (ZFS pool).

**OS:**
-   Any Linux distribution, for example, Ubuntu.<br>
-   There are [other installation methods]({{% ref "/docs/next/install/talos" %}}) which require either any Linux or no OS at all to start.

**BIOS/UEFI Settings:**
-   **Secure Boot.**<br>
    Talos Linux ships pre-signed kernel modules and works with Secure Boot enabled. On non-Talos Ubuntu hosts, the default piraeus-operator flow compiles DRBD in-cluster; the resulting unsigned modules are rejected by kernel lockdown when Secure Boot is enforced. The simplest path is to disable Secure Boot in BIOS/UEFI; alternatively, follow [Ubuntu + Secure Boot]({{% ref "/docs/next/install/kubernetes/ubuntu-secure-boot" %}}) to pre-install dkms-signed DRBD on the host.

**Networking:**
-   Routable FQDN domain.<br>If you don't have one, you can use [nip.io](https://nip.io/) with dash notation
-   Located in the same L2 network segment.
-   Anti-spoofing disabled.<br>
    It is required for MetalLB, the load balancer used in Cozystack.

**Virtual machines:**
-   CPU passthrough enabled and CPU model set to `host` in the hypervisor settings.
-   Nested virtualization enabled.<br>
    Required for virtual machines and tenant kubernetes clusters.
