This guide explains how to install and configure Kubernetes on a Talos Linux cluster using Talm.
As a result of completing this guide you will have a Kubernetes cluster ready to install Cozystack.

[Talm](https://github.com/cozystack/talm) is a Helm-like utility for declarative configuration management of Talos Linux.
Talm was created by Ænix to allow more declarative and customizable configurations for cluster management.
Talm comes with pre-built presets for Cozystack.

## Prerequisites

By the start of this guide you should have [Talos Linux installed]({{% ref "/docs/next/install/talos" %}}), but not initialized (bootstrapped), on several nodes.
These nodes should belong to one subnet or have public IPs.

This guide uses an example where the nodes of a cluster are located in the subnet `192.168.123.0/24`, having the following IP addresses:

- `node1`: private `192.168.123.11` or public `12.34.56.101`.
- `node2`: private `192.168.123.12` or public `12.34.56.102`.
- `node3`: private `192.168.123.13` or public `12.34.56.103`.

Public IPs are optional.
All you need for an installation with Talm is to have access to the nodes: directly, through VPN, bastion host, or other means.
This guide will use private IPs as a default option in examples, and public IPs in instructions and examples which are specific for the public IP setup.

If you are using DHCP, you might not be aware of the IP addresses assigned to your nodes in the private subnet.
Nodes with Talos Linux [expose Talos API on port `50000`](https://www.talos.dev/{{< version-pin "talos_minor" >}}/learn-more/talos-network-connectivity/).
You can use `nmap` to find them, providing your network mask (`192.168.123.0/24` in the example):

```bash
nmap -Pn -n -p 50000 192.168.123.0/24 -vv | grep 'Discovered'
```

Example output:

```console
Discovered open port 50000/tcp on 192.168.123.11
Discovered open port 50000/tcp on 192.168.123.12
Discovered open port 50000/tcp on 192.168.123.13
```


## 1. Install Dependencies

For this guide, you need a couple of tools installed:

-   **Talm**.
    To install the latest build for your platform, download and run the installer script:
    
    ```bash
    curl -sSL https://github.com/cozystack/talm/raw/refs/heads/main/hack/install.sh | sh -s
    ```
    Talm has binaries built for Linux, macOS, and Windows, both AMD and ARM.
    You can also [download a binary from GitHub](https://github.com/cozystack/talm/releases) 
    or [build Talm from the source](https://github.com/cozystack/talm).
    

-   **talosctl** is distributed as a brew package:

    ```bash
    brew install siderolabs/tap/talosctl
    ```

    For more installation options, see the [`talosctl` installation guide](https://www.talos.dev/{{< version-pin "talos_minor" >}}/talos-guides/install/talosctl/)

## 2. Initialize Cluster Configuration

The first step is to initialize configuration templates and provide configuration values for templating.


### 2.1 Initialize Configuration

Start by initializing configuration for a new cluster, using the `cozystack` preset:

```bash
mkdir -p cozystack-cluster
cd cozystack-cluster
talm init --preset cozystack --name mycluster
```

The structure of the project mostly mirrors an ordinary Helm chart:

- `charts` - a directory that includes a common library chart with functions used for querying information from Talos Linux.
- `Chart.yaml` - a file containing the common information about your project; the name of the chart is used as the name for the newly created cluster.
- `templates` - a directory used to describe templates for the configuration generation.
- `secrets.yaml` - a file containing secrets for your cluster.
- `secrets.encrypted.yaml`, `talosconfig.encrypted` - encrypted counterparts produced from `talm.key` (commit these to git instead of the plaintext files).
- `talm.key` - the project-local age key used for encrypt / decrypt. Back this up; without it the encrypted files cannot be reopened.
- `values.yaml` - a common values file used to provide parameters for the templating.
- `.talm-preset.lock` - a machine-managed file recording the preset name and its content hash at init time; used to detect preset drift after a talm binary upgrade. Commit it to git so the baseline is shared across the team.
- `nodes` - an optional directory used to describe and store generated configuration for nodes.

#### Available Presets

`talm` ships two embedded presets:

- `cozystack` - the production preset used by this guide.
- `talm` - a minimal library chart for advanced users who want to build their own preset on top of it.

Pass the preset name via `-p` / `--preset`.

#### `talm init` Flag Reference

Run `talm init -h` for the canonical list. Grouped by mode:

**Create a new project (default mode):**

- `-p, --preset <name>` - preset for file generation.
- `-N, --name <cluster-name>` - cluster name.
- `--endpoints <list>` - Talos API endpoints (comma-separated) embedded into `talosconfig.contexts.<name>.endpoints` for the talosctl client. See "Endpoint flags: talosctl client vs Kubernetes control plane" below.
- `--cluster-endpoint <url>` - Kubernetes control-plane URL written to `values.yaml::endpoint` (e.g. `https://<vip>:6443`). Validated for scheme + host + port at init time.
- `--image <ref>` - override the Talos installer image written to the preset's `values.yaml` (e.g. `factory.talos.dev/installer/<sha256>:<version>`).
- `--talos-version <ver>` - desired Talos contract version for backwards-compatibility templating (e.g. `v1.12`).
- `--force` - overwrite existing files without prompt.

##### Endpoint flags: talosctl client vs Kubernetes control plane

Two distinct concepts share the word "endpoint" in talm projects:

- **`talosconfig.contexts.<name>.endpoints`** - list of `host[:port]` entries the talosctl client uses to reach the Talos API. Populated by `--endpoints` (plural, comma-separated list).
- **`values.yaml::endpoint`** - single URL with scheme + host + port that the chart renders into `cluster.controlPlane.endpoint` of every node's MachineConfig. This is what kubelet and kube-proxy dial. Populated by `--cluster-endpoint` (singular, full URL).

When `--endpoints` is given exactly one value, init auto-derives `values.yaml::endpoint` as `https://<that>:6443` because the single-target case is unambiguous. Multi-endpoint inputs never auto-derive (picking one node would silently couple cluster availability to it) - pass `--cluster-endpoint` explicitly or fill `values.yaml::endpoint` later by hand. The init flow prints a hint at the end when the field is left empty.

**Update an existing project to the latest bundled library chart:**

- `-u, --update` - re-extract `charts/talm/` and other preset-shipped files from the talm binary. `--preset` is required; `--name` is not.
- `--force` - auto-accept every preset-template diff (skip the interactive prompt; safe to use in CI).

`--update` rewrites preset-shipped files only; your `values.yaml`, `secrets.yaml`, `templates/`, and `nodes/` customisations are preserved.

**Manage encrypted secrets in-place:**

- `-e, --encrypt` - encrypt `secrets.yaml` / `talosconfig` / `kubeconfig` into their `.encrypted` counterparts. Requires `talm.key`.
- `-d, --decrypt` - reverse the above. Does not require `--preset` or `--name`.

#### Updating to a Newer Talm Release

When a new talm version ships a newer bundled library chart, refresh your project in place:

```bash
cd cozystack-cluster
talm init --update --preset cozystack          # interactive: prompts for each preset-template diff
talm init --update --preset cozystack --force  # non-interactive: auto-accept all diffs
```

`--update` re-syncs the vendored `charts/talm/` exactly — files that the new library no longer ships (or strays like `.DS_Store`) are pruned — and advances the preset baseline in `.talm-preset.lock`.

#### Chart Drift Detection (Talm v0.32+)

Render commands read the project's local `charts/talm/` copy, never the binary's built-in charts, so upgrading the talm binary does not touch your project — the vendored chart silently goes stale. Release builds of talm detect this and print a non-fatal `WARN:` line on stderr for two independent signals:

- **Library drift**: the vendored `charts/talm/` differs by content from the copy built into the binary. A pure version stamp difference stays silent; a real difference is reported with a sample of the differing paths (`modified:` / `extra:` / `missing:`).
- **Preset drift**: the binary ships a newer preset than the baseline pinned in `.talm-preset.lock` at init time. Your `templates/` edits are never reported as drift — the comparison is binary-vs-baseline, not binary-vs-project.

Both warnings point at the remediation above. To escalate the warning into a hard error (exit 1) — for example, in CI — set `strictCharts: true` in `Chart.yaml` so the whole team inherits it, or pass `--strict-charts` for a single run. Under strict mode, a baseline that cannot be verified (a corrupted or deleted `.talm-preset.lock`, an unreadable `charts/talm/`) also blocks, so deleting the baseline is not a bypass; without strict mode, such failures degrade to a warning, and projects created before baseline pinning stay silent.

#### Encrypt / Decrypt Round-Trip

The encrypted copies are what you commit to git; the plaintext copies are what `talm` reads. Use these to round-trip between the two:

```bash
talm init --encrypt   # secrets.yaml -> secrets.encrypted.yaml; talosconfig -> talosconfig.encrypted
talm init --decrypt   # reverse — does not require --preset or --name
```

Lose the `talm.key` file and the encrypted counterparts become unreadable, so keep a backup of the key out-of-band. When `talm init --decrypt` runs against a project where `talm.key` is missing, talm surfaces both recovery paths in the error hint: restore the backed-up key, or re-run `talm init` to regenerate (with the explicit warning that regenerating writes new secrets, making the old `secrets.encrypted.yaml` undecryptable without the original key).


### 2.2. Edit Configuration Values and Templates

The power of Talm is in templating.
There are several files with source values and templates which you can edit: `Chart.yaml`, `values.yaml`, and `templates/*`.
Talm uses these values and templates to generate Talos configuration for all nodes in the cluster, both control plane and workers.

All configuration values that are often changed, are placed in `values.yaml`:

```yaml
## Used to access the cluster's control plane
endpoint: "https://192.168.100.10:6443"
## Cozystack API cluster domain — used by services and tenant K8s clusters to access the management cluster
clusterDomain: cozy.local
## Floating IP — should be an unused IP in the same subnet as nodes
floatingIP: 192.168.100.10
## Talos source image: pinned to the version that ships with the current Cozystack release
## https://github.com/cozystack/cozystack/pkgs/container/cozystack%2Ftalos
image: "ghcr.io/cozystack/cozystack/talos:{{< version-pin "talos" >}}"
## Pod subnet — used to assign IPs to pods
podSubnets:
- 10.244.0.0/16
## Service subnet — used to assign IPs to services
serviceSubnets:
- 10.96.0.0/16
## Subnet with node IPs
advertisedSubnets:
- 192.168.100.0/24
## Add OIDC issuer URL to enable OIDC — see comments below.
oidcIssuerUrl: ""
certSANs: []
```

You don't need to fill in the node IPs at this step.
Instead, you will provide them later, when you generate node configurations.

#### Extending the rendered Talos config (Talm v0.30+)

The `cozystack` preset ships curated defaults for `machine.kernel.modules`, `machine.sysctls`, `machine.kubelet.extraConfig`, and `machine.files`. Operators wanting to add to any of these without forking the chart use four `extra*` values keys:

| Key | Shape | Semantics on the `cozystack` preset |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `extraKernelModules` | list | Appended to the built-in modules (`openvswitch`, `drbd`, `zfs`, `spl`, `vfio_pci`, `vfio_iommu_type1`). Each entry is a Talos kernel-module spec. |
| `extraKubeletExtraArgs` | map | Merged into `kubelet.extraConfig` after the preset's `cpuManagerPolicy: static`, `maxPods: 512`. Operator keys must NOT collide with built-ins — yaml.v3 rejects duplicate map keys on decode, so a collision fails the render with a precise hint pointing at the offending key. Fork the preset if you need a different default. |
| `extraSysctls` | map | Merged into `machine.sysctls` after the preset's built-in entries: the `gc_thresh1/2/3` ARP-cache sizes, the always-on DRBD/LINSTOR tuning (`tcp_orphan_retries`, `tcp_fin_timeout`, `netdev_max_backlog`, `netdev_budget`, `netdev_budget_usecs`), `vm.nr_hugepages` (when set), and the `tcp_keepalive_*` triplet while `tcpKeepaliveTuning` is enabled. All of these are preset-owned — the same collision-fails-render contract as `extraKubeletExtraArgs` applies. Values must be YAML strings (Talos expects strings even for numeric sysctls). |
| `extraMachineFiles` | list | Appended to the preset's CRI customization and `lvm.conf` entries. Talos rejects duplicate `path:` at apply time. |

Example `values.yaml` addition:

```yaml
extraKernelModules:
  - name: nf_conntrack
extraKubeletExtraArgs:
  feature-gates: "NodeSwap=true"
extraSysctls:
  net.core.somaxconn: "65535"
extraMachineFiles:
  - path: /etc/example.conf
    op: create
    content: "hello = world"
```

The `generic` preset ships no defaults under any of these sections — each block emits only when the matching `extra*` key is non-empty.

Beyond the `extra*` extension points, the `cozystack` preset exposes two opinionated tunables you can change without forking the chart:

| Key | Default | Effect |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `tcpKeepaliveTuning` | `false` | When `true`, adds `net.ipv4.tcp_keepalive_time=600` / `intvl=10` / `probes=6` to `machine.sysctls`, reaping a dead idle socket in ~660s instead of the kernel default ~2h. These sysctls are kernel-wide — they change failure detection for every long-lived idle TCP connection on the node, not just DRBD — so they are opt-in. DRBD already detects dead peers in seconds via its own protocol-level ping, so leave this off unless you specifically want faster node-wide dead-socket detection. |
| `etcd.quotaBackendBytes` | `"8589934592"` (8 GiB) | etcd backend DB size ceiling, emitted as `cluster.etcd.extraArgs.quota-backend-bytes` on controlplane nodes only. Raises etcd's own 2 GiB default so a LINSTOR-heavy control plane holding many DRBD-resource CRDs in aggregate does not trip the NOSPACE alarm. It is a ceiling, not a reservation: a small DB stays small and costs no extra RAM/disk. Set it to `""` to fall back to etcd's built-in default. This governs total DB size, not single-object size — per-object writes stay bounded by kube-apiserver's fixed 3 MiB request-body limit, which has no configuration knob. |

The five always-on DRBD/LINSTOR sysctls listed in the `extraSysctls` row above ship unconditionally on the `cozystack` preset — they address TCP-port exhaustion observed under DRBD reconnect storms and have no equivalent on the `generic` preset.

### 2.3 Add Keycloak Configuration

By default, the cluster will be accessible only by authentication with a token.
However, you can configure an OIDC provider to use account-based authentication.
This configuration starts at this step and continues later, after installing Cozystack.

To configure Keycloak as an OIDC provider, apply the following changes to the templates:

-   For Talm v0.6.6 or later: in `./templates/_helpers.tpl` replace `keycloak.example.com` with `keycloak.<your-domain.tld>`.

-   For Talm earlier than v0.6.6, update `./templates/_helpers.tpl` in the following way:

    ```yaml
     cluster:
       apiServer:
         extraArgs:
           oidc-issuer-url: "https://keycloak.example.com/realms/cozy"
           oidc-client-id: "kubernetes"
           oidc-username-claim: "preferred_username"
           oidc-groups-claim: "groups"
    ```


### 2.4 Encrypted user values and secret redaction (Talm v0.32+)

Beyond `secrets.yaml` (the Talos bootstrap secrets), templates often inject operator-supplied secrets into the config — a registry password, an OIDC client secret, a static-pod env value. Talm lets you keep those encrypted in git the same way as `secrets.yaml`, decrypt them in memory at render time, and keep them out of committed node files, terminal output, and CI logs.

**Step 1 — put the secret values in `values-secret.yaml`:**

```yaml
registryPassword: "s3cr3t-high-entropy-value"
```

**Step 2 — encrypt it** with the project's `talm.key`. `talm init --encrypt` produces `values-secret.encrypted.yaml`. Commit the encrypted file; the plaintext `values-secret.yaml` is git-ignored.

**Step 3 — reference the encrypted file** from `Chart.yaml` by adding it to `templateOptions.valueFiles`, so both `talm template` and `talm apply` read it:

```yaml
templateOptions:
  valueFiles:
    - values-secret.encrypted.yaml
```

Referencing it only via the CLI `--values` flag is a foot-gun: the modeline in a node file does not persist value files, so a later `talm apply` would re-render WITHOUT the secret and silently drop the field. Talm surfaces a warning when an encrypted file is passed via `--values` but is not in `templateOptions.valueFiles`.

**Step 4 — use the values in templates** like any other: `{{ .Values.registryPassword | quote }}`.

How secrets are handled across commands:

| Command | Behavior |
| --- | --- |
| `talm template` (stdout) | secret values render as `***`; `--show-secrets` prints them verbatim. |
| `talm template -I` (node file) | secret values are omitted entirely from the committed node file — the real value is re-rendered in memory only at apply, so no plaintext (or ciphertext) ever lands in `nodes/*.yaml`. |
| `talm apply --dry-run` | both diffs redact secrets: talm's structured drift preview AND the server-returned `Config diff:` block. `--show-secrets-in-drift` reveals them. |

The `--show-secrets-in-drift` flag governs every secret-bearing surface of the apply dry-run, covering both these user values and the Talos bootstrap material (`cluster.ca.key`, `machine.token`, encryption secrets, Wireguard keys, etc.). By default, a dry-run never prints a CA private key or a user secret in cleartext.

`talm apply` honors the full set of value sources, matching `talm template`: `--values`, `--set`, `--set-string`, `--set-file`, `--set-json`, `--set-literal`, merged on top of the `templateOptions.*` defaults from `Chart.yaml`. This keeps `template` and `apply` rendering identically.

**Sharp edge — value-based matching.** Redaction matches by exact value across the whole rendered config, so a secret whose plaintext coincides with an ordinary structural string (a password literally set to `controlplane`, or a bare port like `6443`) will also redact that unrelated field. Prefer high-entropy values; do not encrypt low-entropy strings that collide with non-secret config.


## 3. Generate Node Configuration Files

Next step is to make node configuration files from templates.
Create a `nodes` directory and collect the information from each node into a node-specific file:

```bash
mkdir nodes
talm template -e 192.168.123.11 --nodes 192.168.123.11 -t templates/controlplane.yaml -i > nodes/node1.yaml
talm template -e 192.168.123.12 --nodes 192.168.123.12 -t templates/controlplane.yaml -i > nodes/node2.yaml
talm template -e 192.168.123.13 --nodes 192.168.123.13 -t templates/controlplane.yaml -i > nodes/node3.yaml
```

The `--insecure` (`-i`) parameter is required because Talm must retrieve configuration data
from Talos nodes that are not initialized yet, awaiting in maintenance mode, and therefore unable to accept an authenticated connection.
The nodes will be initialized only on the next step, with `talm apply`.

The generated files include a comment block with discovered network interfaces and disks.
You can edit these files before applying to customize the network configuration.
For example, if you need to configure network bonding (LACP), see
[Configure bonding (LACP)]({{% ref "/docs/next/install/how-to/bonding" %}}).


## 4. Apply Configuration and Bootstrap a Cluster

At this point, the configuration files in `node/*.yaml` are ready for applying to nodes.


### 4.1 Apply Configuration Files

Use `talm apply` to apply the configuration files to the corresponding nodes:

```bash
talm apply -f nodes/node1.yaml -i
talm apply -f nodes/node2.yaml -i
talm apply -f nodes/node3.yaml -i
```

This command initializes nodes, setting up authenticated connection, so that `-i` (`--insecure`) won't be required further on.
If the command succeeded, it will return the node's IP:

```console
$ talm apply -f nodes/node1.yaml -i
- talm: file=nodes/node1.yaml, nodes=[192.168.123.11], endpoints=[192.168.123.11]
```

Later on, you can also use the following options with `talm apply`:

- `--dry-run` - dry run mode will show a diff with the existing configuration without making changes.
- `-m try` - try mode will roll back the configuration in 1 minute.


### 4.2 Wait for Reboot

Wait until all nodes have rebooted.
If an installation media was used, such as a USB stick, remove it to ensure that the nodes boot from the internal disk.

When nodes are ready, they will expose port `50000`, which is a sign that the node has completed Talos configuration and rebooted.
If you need to automate the node readiness check, consider this example:

```bash
timeout 60 sh -c 'until \
  nc -nzv 192.168.123.11 50000 && \
  nc -nzv 192.168.123.12 50000 && \
  nc -nzv 192.168.123.13 50000; \
  do sleep 1; done'
```


### 4.3. Bootstrap Kubernetes

Bootstrap the Kubernetes cluster by running `talm bootstrap` against one of the control plane nodes:

```bash
talm bootstrap -f nodes/node1.yaml
```


## 5. Access the Kubernetes Cluster

At this point, the Kubernetes cluster is ready to install Cozystack.

Before this step, you were interacting with the cluster using Talos API and `talosctl`.
Further steps require Kubernetes API and `kubectl`, which require a `kubeconfig`.


### 5.1. Get a kubeconfig

Use Talm to generate an administrative `kubeconfig`:

```bash
talm kubeconfig -f nodes/node1.yaml
```

This command will produce a `kubeconfig` file in the current directory.


### 5.2. Change Cluster API URL

The `kubeconfig` now has the Cluster API URL set to the floating IP (VIP) in the private subnet.

If you’re using a public IP instead of floatingIP, update the endpoint accordingly.
Edit the `kubeconfig` — change the cluster URL to a public IP of one of the nodes:

```diff
  apiVersion: v1                                                                                                          
  clusters:                                                                                                               
  - cluster:     
      certificate-authority-data: ...                                                                                                         
-     server: https://10.0.1.101:6443   
+     server: https://12.34.56.101:6443   
```


### 5.3. Activate kubeconfig

Finally, set up the `KUBECONFIG` variable or use other tools to make this kubeconfig
accessible to your `kubectl` client:

```bash
export KUBECONFIG=$PWD/kubeconfig
```

{{% alert color="info" %}}
To make this `kubeconfig` permanently available, you can make it the default one (`~/.kube/config`),
use `kubectl config use-context`, or employ a variety of other methods.
Check out the [Kubernetes documentation on cluster access](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/configuration/organize-cluster-access-kubeconfig/).
{{% /alert %}}


### 5.4. Check Cluster Availability

Check that the cluster is available:

```bash
kubectl get ns
```

Example output:

```console
NAME              STATUS   AGE
default           Active   7m56s
kube-node-lease   Active   7m56s
kube-public       Active   7m56s
kube-system       Active   7m56s
```

### 5.5. Check Node State

Check the state of cluster nodes:

```bash
kubectl get nodes    
```

Output shows node status and Kubernetes version:

```console
NAME    STATUS     ROLES           AGE     VERSION
node1   NotReady   control-plane   7m56s   v1.33.1
node2   NotReady   control-plane   7m56s   v1.33.1
node3   NotReady   control-plane   7m56s   v1.33.1
```

Note that all nodes show `STATUS: NotReady`, which is normal at this step.
This happens because the default [Kubernetes CNI plugin](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/extend-kubernetes/compute-storage-net/network-plugins/)
was disabled in the Talos configuration to enable Cozystack installing its own CNI plugin.


## Further Steps

Now you have a Kubernetes cluster bootstrapped and ready for installing Cozystack.
To complete the installation, follow the deployment guide, starting with the
[Install Cozystack]({{% ref "/docs/next/getting-started/install-cozystack" %}}) section.
